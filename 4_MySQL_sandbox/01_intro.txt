Step 1.

SELECT * FROM customers;

Step 2.

Step 3.

SELECT *
FROM products
ORDER BY Price DESC;
Step 4.

SELECT
 customerName,
 COUNT(*) AS 'number of orders'

Note: Step 4 may give you errors if you're using firefox or any other browser other than Chrome, Safari, or Opera. This is because the SQL Try-It Editor is using WebSQL. See here for further discussion of errors that could occur when using firefox. You can use the query below in place of step 4, if you're using firefox:

SELECT
    customerName,
    COUNT(*) AS 'number of orders'
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders
ON orders.customerID = customers.customerID
GROUP BY customerName;
